# Adhya

### Maternal & Child Longitudinal Healthcare Platform

> A secure, FHIR-based, cloud-native healthcare platform for managing maternal health from pre-pregnancy through pregnancy and postpartum, and child health from birth up to five years.

---

## 📌 Overview

**Adhya** is a cloud-native maternal and child healthcare platform designed around a **longitudinal health record**.

Instead of treating every clinic visit as an isolated medical interaction, Adhya connects a mother's healthcare journey with her pregnancy and subsequently connects the pregnancy with the child's health record.

```

The platform is designed around:

* Maternal healthcare
* Pregnancy tracking
* Mother-child relationships
* Child healthcare from birth to five years
* Clinic and appointment management
* Vaccination tracking
* Growth and weight monitoring
* Medication and collection-slot management
* Doctor-patient connectivity
* Clinical data management
* Event-driven health alerts
* FHIR interoperability
* Secure API management
* Post-quantum cryptography research
* Cloud-native Kubernetes deployment
* Controlled healthcare-data access for LLM-based services

The original project specification established the technical foundation around **FHIR, WSO2 API Manager, Siddhi, Kubernetes, OpenChoreo, ML-KEM, ML-DSA, PostgreSQL, and observability**. Adhya refines the healthcare domain around maternal and early-childhood care while preserving those technical research goals.

# 🎯 Problem Statement

Maternal and child healthcare requires information to remain available across multiple stages of a patient's healthcare journey.

A mother's information may span:

```text
Pre-Pregnancy
      ↓
Pregnancy
      ↓
Antenatal Clinics
      ↓
Delivery
      ↓
Postpartum Care
      ↓
Child Birth
      ↓
Child 0–5 Years
```

Important information can therefore be distributed across:

* Patient registration
* OPD records
* Pregnancy records
* Clinic visits
* Clinical observations
* Medication
* Vaccinations
* Weight measurements
* Appointments
* Follow-ups
* Doctor notes
* Alerts

Adhya aims to provide a connected digital representation of this journey.

At the same time, the platform introduces modern distributed-system requirements:

* secure healthcare APIs
* authentication and authorization
* role-based access control
* event-driven processing
* scalable microservices
* healthcare interoperability
* auditability
* observability
* cloud-native deployment
* future-resistant cryptographic research

The technical research question is therefore:

> **How can a longitudinal maternal and child healthcare platform be implemented using FHIR, event-driven architecture, Kubernetes, and post-quantum cryptography while maintaining interoperability, security, scalability, and acceptable performance?**

---

# 🎯 Aim

The main aim of Adhya is to design and implement a **secure, cloud-native, FHIR-based maternal and child healthcare platform** that maintains longitudinal health records from pre-pregnancy through pregnancy and postpartum, and from child birth through five years of age.

The platform will additionally investigate:

* event-driven healthcare monitoring
* API security
* post-quantum cryptography
* hybrid cryptographic migration
* Kubernetes scalability
* observability
* controlled use of healthcare data with LLM-based services

---

# 🧩 Core Concept

The central design principle of Adhya is:

> **Mother → Pregnancy → Delivery → Child → Longitudinal Healthcare**

A mother and child should not be represented as unrelated records.

Instead:

```text
Mother
  │
  ├── Pregnancy #1
  │      │
  │      └── Delivery
  │             │
  │             └── Child
  │
  ├── Pregnancy #2
  │      │
  │      └── Delivery
  │             │
  │             └── Child
  │
  └── Long-Term Medical History
```

This structure allows the platform to preserve healthcare history across time.

---

# 👩 Maternal Healthcare

## Pre-Pregnancy

The mother profile can contain:

* Patient information
* OPD number
* Contact information
* Medical history
* Previous pregnancies
* Previous clinic visits
* Weight history
* Clinical observations
* Medication history
* Vaccination history
* Healthcare provider information
* Relevant follow-up records

---

## Pregnancy Management

Each pregnancy should be represented as an independent longitudinal episode.

Example:

```text
Mother
 │
 └── Pregnancy
       ├── Pregnancy ID
       ├── Pregnancy Number
       ├── Estimated Due Date
       ├── Status
       ├── Clinic Visits
       ├── Observations
       ├── Weight Records
       ├── Medication
       ├── Appointments
       ├── Alerts
       └── Doctor Notes
```

Possible pregnancy states:

```text
PLANNED
   ↓
ACTIVE
   ↓
COMPLETED
   ↓
POSTPARTUM
```

---

# 🏥 Clinic Management

Adhya will support clinic-related workflows.

### Core capabilities

* Register clinic appointments
* Display upcoming clinic dates
* Track completed visits
* Track missed visits
* Provide reminders
* Associate visits with healthcare providers
* Record clinical observations
* Record follow-up requirements

Example:

```text
Pregnancy
    │
    ▼
Clinic Appointment
    │
    ├── Date
    ├── Time
    ├── Clinic
    ├── Doctor
    ├── Status
    └── Follow-up
```

---

# 💊 Medication Management

The platform can manage medication-related information throughout the maternal and child healthcare journey.

Example:

```text
Prescription
     │
     ▼
Medication
     │
     ▼
Collection / Booking Slot
     │
     ▼
Reminder
     │
     ▼
Collection Status
```

Possible collection states:

```text
AVAILABLE
BOOKED
COLLECTED
MISSED
CANCELLED
```

The system can notify users about specific medicine collection slots.

---

# 👶 Child Healthcare

The child becomes a separate patient record while maintaining a relationship with the mother and pregnancy from which the child originated.

```text
Mother
   │
   ▼
Pregnancy
   │
   ▼
Delivery
   │
   ▼
Child
   │
   ├── Birth Information
   ├── Vaccinations
   ├── Growth Records
   ├── Clinic Visits
   ├── Observations
   ├── Medication
   ├── Developmental Records
   ├── Alerts
   └── Clinical Notes
```

The initial scope covers children from:

> **Birth → 5 years**

---

# 💉 Vaccination Management

Adhya will provide vaccination tracking for children.

Each vaccination record may contain:

* Vaccine
* Dose
* Recommended date
* Actual administration date
* Status
* Healthcare provider
* Clinic
* Notes

Possible statuses:

```text
SCHEDULED
COMPLETED
MISSED
RESCHEDULED
```

Example:

```text
Child
 │
 ├── Vaccine A
 │     ├── Dose 1 ✓
 │     ├── Dose 2 ✓
 │     └── Dose 3 ○
 │
 ├── Vaccine B
 │     └── Dose 1 ✓
 │
 └── Upcoming Vaccination
       └── Reminder
```

---

# ⚖️ Growth & Weight Monitoring

Weight monitoring is one of the initial functional requirements.

The platform will maintain a chronological history:

```text
Child
 │
 └── Growth Records
       │
       ├── Date
       ├── Weight
       ├── Height
       ├── Age
       └── Notes
```

Example:

```text
Weight
 │
 ├── 3 months → 5.2 kg
 ├── 6 months → 6.7 kg
 ├── 9 months → 7.5 kg
 ├── 12 months → 8.4 kg
 └── 18 months → 9.8 kg
```

The platform can visualize historical measurements for healthcare-provider review.

> Growth visualization is intended as a monitoring and record-keeping feature, not an autonomous diagnostic system.

---

# 👨‍⚕️ Doctor & Patient Connection

Adhya will provide a healthcare-provider dashboard.

Doctors or authorized healthcare workers can:

* Search patients
* View maternal profiles
* View pregnancy records
* View child profiles
* Review longitudinal health history
* Review observations
* Review weight/growth records
* Review vaccination status
* Review appointments
* Review medication
* Create clinical notes
* Review alerts
* Schedule follow-ups

The initial implementation focuses on a **clinical dashboard and secure record access**, rather than full telemedicine functionality.

---

# 🪪 OPD Number

Each registered patient will receive an OPD number.

Example:

```text
OPD-2026-000123
```

However, the OPD number should not be the only identifier used internally.

The system should maintain:

```text
Internal Patient ID
        +
OPD Number
```

The internal identifier should remain immutable while the OPD number is treated as a healthcare-facing identifier.

---

# 🗂️ Longitudinal Patient Profile

A major feature of Adhya is the long-term patient profile.

### Mother

```text
Mother Profile
│
├── Registration
├── OPD Information
├── Personal Information
├── Pregnancy History
├── Current Pregnancy
├── Clinic Visits
├── Observations
├── Weight History
├── Medication
├── Appointments
├── Alerts
├── Doctor Notes
└── Audit History
```

### Child

```text
Child Profile
│
├── Birth Information
├── Parent Relationship
├── Vaccinations
├── Growth Records
├── Clinic Visits
├── Observations
├── Medication
├── Developmental Records
├── Appointments
├── Alerts
└── Clinical Notes
```

---

# 🧬 FHIR Architecture

Healthcare data will be represented using **HL7 FHIR** rather than a completely proprietary healthcare schema.

The original project specification identifies FHIR as a core interoperability requirement and includes resources such as Patient, Practitioner, Observation, and Appointment.

Adhya extends this model around maternal and child healthcare.

### Proposed mapping

| Adhya Domain           | FHIR Resource                                                 |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mother                 | `Patient`                                                     |
| Child                  | `Patient`                                                     |
| Doctor                 | `Practitioner`                                                |
| Doctor relationship    | `CareTeam` / `PractitionerRole`                               |
| Pregnancy              | `Condition` / `EpisodeOfCare`                                 |
| Clinic Visit           | `Encounter`                                                   |
| Clinical Measurement   | `Observation`                                                 |
| Medication             | `MedicationRequest`                                           |
| Vaccination            | `Immunization`                                                |
| Appointment            | `Appointment`                                                 |
| Clinical Documentation | `DocumentReference` / appropriate clinical resource           |
| Alert                  | `Communication` / `DetectedIssue` depending on implementation |

> Exact FHIR mappings will be finalized during the FHIR domain-model design stage.

# 🔄 Longitudinal Healthcare Flow

A central workflow is:

```text
Patient Registration
        ↓
OPD Number Assignment
        ↓
Mother Profile
        ↓
Pregnancy Registration
        ↓
Pregnancy Timeline
        ↓
Clinic Visits
        ↓
Observations
        ↓
Medication
        ↓
Appointments / Reminders
        ↓
Delivery
        ↓
Child Registration
        ↓
Child Health Record
        ↓
Vaccinations
        ↓
Growth Monitoring
        ↓
Clinic Visits
        ↓
Observations
        ↓
Medication
        ↓
Child Age 5
```

---

# ⚡ Event-Driven Healthcare Monitoring

Healthcare observations can generate events.

Example:

```text
Clinical Observation
        ↓
Healthcare Event
        ↓
Siddhi
        ↓
Pattern Detection
        ↓
Alert
        ↓
Doctor Dashboard / Notification
```

For example, a predefined rule could detect repeated abnormal observations within a configured time window.

```text
Observation 1
      ↓
Observation 2
      ↓
Observation 3
      ↓
   Siddhi
      ↓
Pattern Detected
      ↓
Alert Created
```

The original project specification proposed Siddhi specifically for detecting patterns such as repeated abnormal observations within a time window.

---

# 🚨 Alert System

The alert service consumes detected healthcare events.

Example:

```json
{
  "patientId": "patient-123",
  "type": "ObservationPattern",
  "title": "Repeated Observation Pattern Detected",
  "severity": "HIGH",
  "detectedAt": "2026-09-24T12:30:00Z",
  "status": "OPEN"
}
```

Alerts may be associated with:

* Mother
* Pregnancy
* Child
* Observation
* Appointment
* Vaccination
* Medication
* Follow-up

The system should distinguish between:

```text
System Alert
Clinical Review Required
Reminder
Appointment Notification
Vaccination Reminder
Medication Notification
```

---

# 🤖 Health Data & LLM API

Adhya may include an **LLM gateway** for controlled interaction with healthcare information.

The LLM should not directly access the entire healthcare database.

Instead:

```text
FHIR / Clinical Records
          ↓
Authorization
          ↓
Data Filtering
          ↓
De-identification / Minimization
          ↓
Context Builder
          ↓
LLM Gateway
          ↓
LLM API
          ↓
Controlled Response
```

Possible use cases include:

* Doctor-facing patient summaries
* Summarizing longitudinal records
* Explaining non-diagnostic healthcare information
* Summarizing appointment history
* Preparing structured information for healthcare workers

### Important Principle

> **The LLM is an information-support component, not an autonomous clinical decision-maker.**

The system should not allow an LLM to independently:

* diagnose patients
* prescribe medication
* modify medical records
* determine treatment
* override healthcare professionals

---

# 🔐 LLM Security

Because healthcare data is highly sensitive, the LLM gateway will be treated as a security boundary.

Potential security concerns include:

* Excessive data exposure
* Unauthorized patient-context access
* Prompt injection
* Sensitive information leakage
* Cross-patient context contamination
* Insecure tool access
* Insufficient audit logging
* Unauthorized model access
* Improper data retention

A secure architecture should therefore enforce:

```text
User
 ↓
Authentication
 ↓
Authorization

# 🔐 Security Architecture

Security will be implemented as a multi-layer architecture.

```text
                    Security
                       │
       ┌───────────────┼────────────────┐

   Identity        API Security       Data
       │               │                │
 OAuth2/OIDC       WSO2 APIM       PostgreSQL

       ▼
   PQC Security
       │
   ┌───┴────┐
   │        │
 ML-KEM   ML-DSA
```

Security requirements include:

* Authentication
* Authorization
* RBAC
* API gateway policies
* Rate limiting
* TLS
* Secure secrets
* Audit logging
* Network isolation
* Secure service communication
* Cryptographic experimentation

---

# 🧬 Post-Quantum Cryptography

PQC remains one of the major research components of Adhya.

The project will investigate:

### ML-KEM

Used for key establishment.

```text
Client
   │
   │ ML-KEM
   ▼
Server
   │
   ▼
Shared Secret
```

### ML-DSA

Used for digital signatures.

```text
Healthcare Event
       ↓
   ML-DSA Sign
       ↓
 Signed Event
       ↓
Verification
```

The purpose is not simply to add a cryptographic library.

The project will investigate the architectural and performance implications of integrating PQC into a distributed healthcare platform.

---

# 🔀 Hybrid Cryptography

Adhya will investigate three configurations:

```text
┌─────────────────────┐
│ Classical            │
│ Cryptography         │
└─────────────────────┘

          VS

┌─────────────────────┐
│ Post-Quantum         │
│ Cryptography         │
└─────────────────────┘

          VS

┌─────────────────────┐
│ Hybrid               │
│ Classical + PQC     │
└─────────────────────┘
```

The project will measure the trade-offs rather than assuming that one configuration is universally optimal.

---

# 📊 PQC Performance Benchmarking

The platform will provide controlled experiments comparing cryptographic approaches.

| Metric           | Classical |     PQC |  Hybrid |
| ---------------- | --------: | ------: | ------: |
| Key Generation   |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Signing          |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Verification     |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Key Size         |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Signature Size   |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Ciphertext Size  |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Request Latency  |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| CPU Usage        |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Memory Usage     |   Measure | Measure | Measure |
| Network Overhead |   Measure | Measure | Measure |

Experiments should be conducted under controlled conditions.

Kubernetes resource limits can additionally be used to investigate cryptographic overhead under constrained CPU and memory conditions.

---

# 🧾 Audit Logging

Healthcare systems require traceability of sensitive operations.

Adhya will maintain audit events such as:

```text
Doctor01
   │
   ├── READ Patient/123
   │
   ├── CREATE Observation/456
   │
   ├── UPDATE Observation/456
   │
   └── READ Vaccination/789
```

Example audit record:

```json
{
  "actor": "doctor-001",
  "action": "READ",
  "resourceType": "Patient",
  "resourceId": "patient-123",
  "timestamp": "2026-09-25T10:30:00Z",
  "ip": "internal",
  "result": "SUCCESS"
}
```

Audit records should be treated as security-sensitive information.

# 🧪 Synthetic Data

Adhya is intended for software engineering and research experimentation.

Development and benchmarking should use **synthetic healthcare data**.

Example:

```text
Mother:
OPD-2026-000001

Pregnancy:
PREG-2026-000001

Child:
CHILD-2026-000001

Observation:
OBS-2026-000001
```

No real patient data should be introduced into the development environment.

---

# ⚠️ Scope & Limitations

## Included

* Maternal healthcare records
* Pregnancy records
* Child healthcare records
* Birth information
* Clinic management
* Appointment reminders
* Medication management
* Medicine collection slots
* Vaccination tracking
* Growth/weight monitoring
* Clinical observations
* Doctor dashboard
* FHIR resources
* API management
* Authentication and authorization
* Event processing
* Alerts
* PQC experimentation
* Hybrid cryptography
* Kubernetes
* OpenChoreo
* Observability
* LLM healthcare-data gateway

* A complete hospital information system
* A production replacement for certified healthcare infrastructure
* An autonomous medical diagnosis system
* Autonomous treatment recommendations
* Autonomous prescription generation
* A complete telemedicine platform
* A replacement for healthcare professionals
* A system using real patient data during development
* A claim of complete quantum security

The original project specification explicitly positioned the platform as a working prototype and experimental platform rather than a complete certified healthcare infrastructure.

---

# 🔒 Security Principles

Adhya follows several core security principles:

### Least Privilege

Users should only access the healthcare information required for their role.

### Defense in Depth

Security should not depend on a single mechanism.

```text
Identity
   +
Authorization
   +
API Security
   +
Network Security
   +
Data Security
   +
Audit
   +
PQC Research
```

### Data Minimization

Only the healthcare information necessary for a particular operation should be provided to downstream services, especially LLM services.

### Secure by Design

Security requirements should be considered during architecture and domain design rather than added after implementation.

### Auditability

Sensitive healthcare operations should produce auditable events.

# 🔬 Research Focus

The project should ultimately answer a broader engineering question:

> **What does it take to build a secure, interoperable, event-driven, cloud-native healthcare platform while preparing its cryptographic infrastructure for the post-quantum era?**

Adhya provides a concrete healthcare domain in which these technologies can be implemented, measured, and evaluated together.

---

# 📜 Disclaimer

Adhya is an academic and research-oriented prototype.

It is not intended to:

* provide medical diagnosis;
* replace healthcare professionals;
* make autonomous clinical decisions;
* prescribe treatment;
* replace certified healthcare infrastructure; or
* process real patient information during development.

All development and experimentation should use synthetic healthcare data.

---

# 🤝 Contributing

Contributions should maintain the project's core principles:

* Security first
* Privacy by design
* FHIR interoperability
* Clear service boundaries
* Testable components
* Observable services
* Least-privilege access
* Synthetic data for development
* Reproducible experiments
